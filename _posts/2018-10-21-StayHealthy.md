Let's face it. As much as a lot of us would love to drop everything and spend a year traveling the world, the reality for many of us is that we'll actually be spending most of our forseeable days at that 9 to 5 desk job. 

But hey, that doesn't mean that we can't take care of our bodies along the way right? I personally would like to be healthy when I can finally use the money that vanishes biweekly into that 401k phantom zone.

There are already so many wisdoms out there about staying healthy in the workplace: get a standing desk, don't drink too much coffee, get some fresh air, etc. This all sounds pretty good to be honest and you should follow it if it suits you. I wanted to put some numbers out there to quantatatively compare two potential work days.

## Work Day 1:

Sit working for 8 hours straight, getting up only to use the bathroom or get a coffee.
Calories burned: **1826 calories** (Calories expended per day at rest for somone of my height, weight, age, and sex)

## Work Day 2:

Take **two 10 minute walks** during the day and a **20 minute walk** during my hour lunch.
Calories burned: 1826 calories burned resting + (2.72 calories/minute walked)*(40 minutes) = **1935 calories**

So in the active work day, I burn 109 more calories. I can hear you saying: "Pshh .. what's that like a Hershey's Chocolate Bar?".

<insert viz of hersheys bar equals 210 calories>

Well, it actually is a Hershey's candy bar (210 calories), but we can also think of it in terms of weight loss over time.

Let's say that I am currently eating enough calories to keep me at my current weight of 170 (not losing or gaining weight). Now, let's say all I change in my life is to start doing these walks every workday (just weekdays). Even by a conservative estimate, I'd be able to lose around 10 pounds within in a year, which is no small feat.

I just wanted to shed some light on the power of intentional repeated micro-decisions. That is, small but consistent changes you purposely make to your life which generate real long term positive growth.
