# Motivations

One year ago, I was a few months into my first full-time job, was still learning how to be a funtional human being, and was one pound shy of having an obese BMI. Something needed to be done. 

So, I started tracking my calories in, calories out, and weight each day just as a way to keep track of how I was doing healthwise. The intial goal was just to see if lowering my net calories had any effect on my weight over time. While this is one of the questions I was able to answer, this journey of counting calories became about a lot more in the past year.

I wanted to talk about the biggest positives I've experienced from tracking my health as well as the biggest downsides I faced in this experience. Hopefully this helps you to decide whether or not health tracking is a good fit for you!

# Key Positive 1 - Measurable Progress Over Time

The definite biggest postive from my health tracking was that it gave me the ability to **visually track my progress over time** and see if any changes I was making (positive or negative) were having any effects on my health. Since my primary objective in the beginning was to lose weight, that is the story I wanted to talk about here. 

While your rate of weight loss will depend on several other factors like genetics and activity level, the usual idea is that the lower you keep your net calories, the more weight you can lose. Let's take a look at my net calories over time first.

## Net Calories Over Time

* While the raw data (in blue) is pretty noisy, once we take a rolling average (in red), the true trend becomes more apparent. My net calories had been steadily increasing since I started collecting data, eventually spiking at the end of April with around 3500 net calories per day (Yikes!)
* Honestly, at that point I remember consistently feeling tired and heavy all the time and realized that if I wanted to reduce my net calories I either needed to increase my calories out or decrease my calories in. The issue was clearly with my calories in (I was eating way too much), so I made a conscious effort to consume fewer calories
* After that point, my net calories dipped towards the end of May and have since stabilized to just under 2000
* An additional interesting point is that my net calorie volatility (how wild the blue graph is) has been reducing since the volatility peaked in April, meaning that I found myself with a more consistent caloric schedule between one day and the next

Taking a look now at my weight in the same time period:

* I was really excited for that initial dip from 180 to 165 which ended in mid-December. I thought that I would continue to lose weight at the same rate forever, but I was definitely wrong
* After my initial weight loss sprint, I found my mentality relax and let myself eat more (as evidenced by the net calories graph above), which eventually cost me. By mid April, I was pretty much might back where I started at the beginning of all this
* Even when I got my act togeter a little bit and started controlling my eating, my weight didn't really change and instead hovered around 175 for several months.
* Only in the last two months (September and October) have I seen weights as low as those from last December. I think part of that is that I stopped tracking weight daily but more on that later!

Of course, we haven't seen net calories and weight on the same graph yet so let's see how they compare. Since they are on different scales, I have normalized both of them (essentially get them on the same scale without changing the shape of the data).

## How do Net Calories correlate with Weight?

* The first month seems odd since my net calories are increasing while my weight is rapidly dropping, but I attribute this more to the fact that last November is when I first started seriously working out after several college years of relative inactivity. My body seemed to appreciate that
* The really cool thing is that after the first month, these two lines seem to follow each other rather closesly, especially since this March! If you're wondering why there is no data past July, that's because I stopped tracking my daily weight in early August, but as promised, more on that soon


# Data Collection

As noted above, this project initially started by just measuring three metrics each day: **Calories In**, **Calories Out**, and *Weight**. From these three measured metrics, I derived, at first, one additional metric which was **Net Calories** which is simply **Calories In minus Calories Out**. 

I measured calories in as accurately as possible, researching nutrition facts when they were available, and making my best estimate when nutrition facts were not readily available. Similarly, I calculated calories out by consulting caloric burn rates for various exersizes based on my weight at the time. It is also important to note that the calories out you see in the upcoming data does *not* include calories burned at rest. That is, I recorded calories burned from intentional physical activities only. 

I calculated weight using an electronic weighing scale I have at home.

I later started recording the **Out-In Ratio** which is simply defined as **Calories Out divided by Calories In**. I also started tracking my mood which I simply picked as either being **happy, neutral, or sad**. This one was definitely the least scientific metric bu nevertheless one which helped me think about why my day went the way that it did.
